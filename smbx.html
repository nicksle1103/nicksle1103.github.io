            <b>The Challenge</b>
          </div>
          <div class="cs-text">
            <p>We began our project wanting to address the problem of food insecurity and sustainability in the United States. The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food security as "access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life.” Food insecurity is an issue faced daily by us, our peers, and our neighbors due to a lack of price inclusive, nutritious foods. This motivated us to understand the topic more and come up with creative solutions to help alleviate this pressing problem.  Additionally, we wanted to be able to address food insecurity in a way that promoted food sustainability.  When buying groceries, most shoppers don't consider the carbon footprint associated with the produce.  Grocery store produce creates a large carbon footprint because of the amount of energy required to carry the produce from the farm to the store.</p>

         <p>WeGrow is a concept app that helps community members familiarize themselves with their local community garden.  The app's core functionality is catered towards assiting garden goers with locating their desired produce in a timely manner.  Additionally, WeGrow acts to keep the community up to date with the community happenings, through a digital task / event board.  Ultimately, WeGrow aims to increase participation and access to these local gardens, and promote a sustainable and accessible way of consuming.</p>

            <p>Looking back at the work that I have completed with my group, I am extremely proud of our solution and would love to take further steps to implement it within the local community garden's within Berkeley.  Although not mentioned within the case study, and integral part of solution was a "manager facing" application that communicated with the "consumer facing" mobile app.  These ideas piqued the interest of the community garden managers and our group has considered developing the applications for practical use.  WeGrow seems like a first great step in increasing accessibility to sustainable foods, but unfortunately it is not the most scalable design solution. Going forward, I want to do more research and hopefully design a solution focused on providing large scale access to sustainable foods.  Some technologies and areas of research that I think are viable are: lab grown meats, farmer’s markets and community operated groceries.</p>
