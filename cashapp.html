				<b>Introduction</b>
			</div>
			<div class="cs-text">
				<p>During the Summer of 2019, I was given the opportunity to intern at Cash App in the New York City office.  From this experience, I was not only able to receive mentorship from great designers, but also given the autonomy to design important features within two different Cash App work streams: the Ecosystems work stream and the Boosts work stream.  The internship provided me with insight on how to participate in design critiques, a better understanding of the collaboration required between designers and different disciplines, and helped me build my confidence as a designer.  My biggest takeaway from this experience was a renewed excitement towards product design and a realization of my weaknesses as a designer (especially within a company setting) and how to improve on those weaknesses.  Unfortunately, I cannot publish a lot of the designs that I worked on as those features have not yet been released to the public; but if you want to hear about my experience, feel free to reach out to me! </p>

				<ul class="cs-intro-list">
					<li>Project Duration: 6 Weeks </li>
					<li>Product Feature Design</li>
					<li>Team: Ecosystems Workstream</li>
					<li>Role: Product Designer</li>
					<li>Tools: Figma, Principle</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The Ecosystems project was the first feature I worked on during my internship at Cash App.  This project was more UI/UX intensive, resulting in a very iterative process to designing.  During this time, I collaborate with other designers to u.  Something new that I experienced was designing for both a base level "V1" while also thinking about how the feature could and should evolve for the future.  The biggest takeaway that I learned from working on this project is to discuss my process <b>early and often</b>.</p>

			<div class="cs-text">
				<ul class="cs-intro-list">
					<li>Project Duration: 5 Weeks </li>
					<li>Product Feature Design</li>
					<li>Team: Boosts Workstream</li>
					<li>Role: Product Designer</li>
					<li>Tools: Figma, Principle</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The second project I worked on was within the Boost workstream.  This project required less actual pixel pushing and required more work on designing a system as to how a feature should function.  From working on this project, I realized how important it was to take initiative with reaching out to PMs and engineers who could provide better context with the feature I was working on.  Additionally, this project really challenged me to think more in-depth about edge cases and how to design for them.</p>
