                    <p>Through the class IEOR 170: Industrial Desing and Human Factors, I was given the chance to work with a great group to tackle an issue that was dear to our hearts: food sustainability and food accessibility in the Bay Area.  The project was intended to be a semester long study and was culminated with a final prototype, a presentation poster and a video.  Throughout the semester, our team explored many product solutions ranging from physical products to digital software solutions; ultimately our group decided that the best solution was to create a digital application.  Our design process required us to do user ethnography in the form of multiple interviews, and the creation of personas and user journey maps based on the observations from the aforementioned interviews.  The creation of the actual design solution was created using Sketch and prototyped using InVision.</p>

                             <p>We began our project wanting to address the problem of food insecurity and sustainability in the United States. The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food security as "access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life.” Food insecurity is an issue faced daily by us, our peers, and our neighbors due to a lack of price inclusive, nutritious foods. This motivated us to understand the topic more and come up with creative solutions to help alleviate this pressing problem.  Additionally, we wanted to be able to address food insecurity in a way that promoted food sustainability.  When buying groceries, most shoppers don't consider the carbon footprint associated with the produce.  Grocery store produce creates a large carbon footprint because of the amount of energy required to carry the produce from the farm to the store.</p>

                    <p>After defining the purpose of our design, we sought to narrow the scope of our mission and figure out how we were actually going to tackle such a big problem as food sustainability/accessibility.  To do this, our team focused on performing secondary research to understand how others have attempted in solving this problem.  Additionally, our team conducted quick interviews with community members from Berkeley and Oakland to understand their feelings about their current access to sustainable foods.   From our research, we found 3 viable design solutions and compared their pros and cons:</p>

                    <p>Our group decided that community gardens were the best vehicle in solving food sustainability/accessibility in the Bay Area.  The rational behind this decision came from the observation that many residents seemed willing to participate in the community gardens, but often do not because they are not aware of the resources available to them.  Additionally, we found farmers markets to be to inaccessible to the community even though their access to local produce allows for a smaller carbon footprint.  Ultimately, we deduced that community gardens were the best choice because not only did they create a much smaller carbon footprint than supermarket produce, but they were also much more widely accessible.  With this in mind,  we created pre- and post-intervention interview questions and conducted formal interviews.  We compiled the observations from these interviews and indentified key insights which we used to help frame our design process.</p>

                    <p>Knowing what our users needed to better use community gardens, we brainstormed the best way to implement these features in an easy to use and accessible way.  We decided that we needed to do a systems redesign of the community garden as well as design an app to help facilitate information pertaining to the garden.</p>

                        <h3><b>Systems Redesign</b></h3>
                    </div>

                    <p>For the systems redesign of the community garden, we wanted to put a larger focus on the community aspect of the garden.  Instead of just having a garden where community members can pick up produce, we wanted to make the garden a hub of activity that excites the community to partake in the gardening.  To execute this, we suggested that the community managers plan more community events where members can hold workshops related to the garden; in addition, we suggested that managers spend time highlighting certain community members every week.  Another major system redesign would be the restructuring of the garden into a grid based system that streamlines the process of finding produce.</p>

                        <h3><b>Concept App Design</b></h3>
                    </div>

                    <p>A mobile app was the easiest way to implement core features that attended to user needs.  A mobile app provides an accessible medium for users to see what produce are available as well as see what task need to be completed in the garden.  In addition, a mobile app provides the capability to provide live time updates on vital information such as change in produce stocks, completion of tasks, or upcoming events.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>After determining what features we should implemented based on user needs, we created our first prototype user flows to see if our predicted group would have any issues with the task process.  In creating the user flows we focused on two main features: a “picking produce” feature that allows users to easily find their desired produce & provide live updates on the condition and stock, and a second “scheduler” feature that facilitates the tasks assignments and event information.</p>

                    <div class="">
                        <h3><b>Picking Produce Prototypes</b></h3>
                    </div>

                    <p>When creating the mid fidelity prototypes of the “picking produce” feature, we really wanted to focus on creating a concise user flow that reduced the burden placed on the users when providing an update on the stock and condition of the produce.  We used the amount of clicks the user has to take to complete an action as the measurement of how burdensome a task is, thus our goal in testing the prototypes was to create user flows that required the least amount of screen interaction to complete a task.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In the first iteration of the picking produce user flow prototype, we focused on allowing users to easily identify where their desired produce was by presenting them with a grid based map which they could scope out and discover which produce was available in each section.  After finding and selecting their desired produce, the user was them prompted to fill in the current stock of the produce, and how many they took.  After having non-group members test the prototype and receiving feedback, we realized that the user flow was too tedious and unintuitive, with a major flaw being that selecting the area on the map before choosing the produce caused confusion and resulted in more of the user’s time being wasted. </p>

                    <p>In the second iteration, we were able to reduce the amount of screen clicks required by the user to complete the action by implementing a drop down menu that listed the produce name with the grid number next  to it.  Unfortunately, this design does not provide a clear indication of the produce status and users would have to view the produce main page to see this information.  Our final iteration attempts to fix these issues through the use of a new layout and the implementation of color.</p>

                    <p>The initial idea when creating the prototype for the scheduler feature was to create a calendar feature that the user could with from a “community” view (which included community events) and a “personal” view (which allowed users to track their own produce and tasks).  We also allowed users to toggle between a monthly and weekly view.  Overall, users were extremely confused with the prototype and were confused as to how to access tasks and even how to view events.  In our final design, we scrapped the calendar idea and focused on created a succinct task board.</p>

Additionally, the dashboard promotes community engagement with recommended and favorited content, allowing users to see their current interactions with the garden.  Another large component of the dashboard is the promotion of featured content including the featured produce and featured community member.  The inclusion of these featured content is a form of community outreach and acts to instill excitement towards the community garden.</p>

                    <p>A key design choice for the app was to use an intuitive color scheme to help guide users through the app.  The implementation of a familiar “stop-light” color scheme allows users to easily understand the status of things without the need to see further text.  Within the task board feature, WeGrow uses the color scheme to convey the urgency of a certain task and to highlight the status of an event.  Within the picking produce feature, the color indicates the status and stock of a certain produce.</p>

WeGrow also introduces a low burden method for users to updates on stock and condition though the use of colored sliders.  The sliders have a similar color scheme as in the main produce page, allowing users to understand that green means good, yellow moderate, and red low/bad.</p>
